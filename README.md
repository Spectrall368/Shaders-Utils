## Info

Shaders Utils is a plugin that allows you to apply a custom shader or a minecraft shader in minecraft, the plugin currently adds 10 new procedures to MCreator of which an exclusive procedure for 1.14.4 and for versions after 1.16.5 (excluded), and two exclusive for versions lower than 1.16.5 (included). To apply a shader you must first check that the world is client side and that the entity is a player otherwise you may crash the game. You must always compare the "get shader group" (avaiable for versions below 1.16.5, included) procedure with the null procedure otherwise it will give you an error, the same thing goes for the procedure "is the shader active" from 1.17.1 (included) onwards.
